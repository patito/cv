\section{Summary} \texttt{smeagol@/home/gladden \$ cat profile.txt}

Nerd, hobbit, dwarf. These are the words I had heard most when I was a younger.
No, don't get me wrong I would be happy to be Froddo, however I think I'm more
like Smeagol. Anyway if you don't know what I'm talking about, no worries
I'm kinda weirdo $\ddot\smile$ .

Hi, my name is Paulo Leonardo Benatto, but feel free to call me smeagol.
I'm a passionate and eternal learner software developer from south Brazil, but since 2014 I've been
living and working in Brighton, UK. In this moment I work at Brandwatch where
I'm part of the Core Systems team. What that means? TBH I don't know, but I spend
most of my days reading stack overflow (my lover and soulmate), automating
tasks using python, some golang and javascript. I also have been learning and
working with sensu, puppet and linux.

I'm a good mood guy and I like to think that I'm a people person as well,
because I really enjoy working in a team, pair programming, talking about
solutions, code and complaining about java (just a joke =).

If you are reading my profile feel free to get in contact or invite me for a barbecue.
